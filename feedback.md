# What was your favorite part of the class?
Overall, the class was great! Writing code was very enjoyable to me; my favorite part about coding is at first it looks like utter nonsense (just letters, numbers, and symbols) but once the map appeared it really made it worth it.
Coding is difficult but with time I got use to it.

# What was your least favorite part of the class?
Class was amazing! But my least favorite part was waking up in the morning. I work for a catering company where we cater to large special events. Typically, I get home at 2am and after that it takes me an addition 2 hours to wind down. It was really a struggle for me to wake up for class early Saturday morning, after falling asleep around 4am every Friday night. Then, going back to work to do it all over again! :(

#  Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
I do not think you need suggestions because your class is really enjoyable and I really liked the labs! I am a person who works well on my own so I felt this class set me up for success. I learned a lot and if I had a chance I would like to take more classes from you.
