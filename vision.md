# What is your "Dream"/tech job?
My dream is to work for an environmental consultant where I can utilize my GIS skills. Prior to this program I had only taken 3 courses of GIS. As excited as I was to begin the program, I felt I was not as experienced in GIS as others in my cohort. Now, I feel confident in my skills and I know that I can definitely find a job that will combine my love for GIS and Biology. If there is a job out there that also combines remote sensing and coding like in this class, I would be thrilled to do that as well.

# What GIS application or technologies excite you most?
I will say remote sensing, creating orthomosaics, and spatial analysis excited me the most. I want to use applications that biologists use when entering data in GIS.

# What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
I want to continue practicing my skills in remote sensing. I really enjoyed your applied remote sensing class and I would like to know if there is more Earth Labs. If I can not find a job for biology, I can see myself coding for remote sensing. Therefore, I am going to keep practicing my coding because I really enjoyed it. Other non-GIS hobbies I would like to get myself into is getting my M1 license, do more camping, and start rockclimbing!!!
