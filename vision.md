# What is your "Dream"/tech job?
my dream is working for an environmental consultant where I can utilize my GIS skills. When I entered this program,
I was not as capable as others since I only have taken 3 courses of GIS before entering this program. Now, I know that I can definitely 
find a job that can combine GIS and biology.

# What is your GIS application or technologies excite you most?
I will say remote sensing, creating orthomosaics, and spatial analysis. I want to use application that biologist when entering data
in GIS

# What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would like to focus on after this semester ends?
I want to continue for training for remote sensing. I really enjoyed your applied remote sensing class and I would to know if there
is more Earth Labs. If I can find a job for biology, I can see myself coding for remote sensing. Therefore, I am going to keep practicing my coding because I really enjoyed it. Other hobbies is to get my M1 license, camping, and rockcliing!!!
